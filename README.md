# JapaneseLearningHelper
JapaneseLearningHelper is a project designed to assist in learning Japanese vocabulary through two core libraries: MenuVisualizer and VocabularyMemorizationHelper.

- MenuVisualizer: This library provides a command-line interface (CLI) to display menus and interact with users. It handles all the graphical elements within the console environment.

- VocabularyMemorizationHelper: This library powers a vocabulary testing application, offering two test modes:
  1. Chinese to Japanese translation
  2. Japanese to Chinese translation

Both libraries work together to create an effective and interactive vocabulary learning experience directly through the command line.
